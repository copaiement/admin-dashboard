# Admin Dashboard

## About
This is the code for a fairly standard Admin Dashboard

## Goals
* Set up page
* Use grid for all sections and subsections

## Thoughts
Overall a pretty standard website layout. I followed the assignement and used grid everywhere but there were definitely areas where flex would have made more sense, were I making this with no directions. I also added a "dark mode" toggle as a fun extra, as I wanted to use more CSS variables.
